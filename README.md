### My favourite food - Chicken Biryani

**Biryani, in itself, is a complete delicacy**. The second reason for liking is the awesome mix of the flavors of Basmati rice with selected spices. This simply takes it to a completely new level. Next is the type of cooking style used, that is , the **“Dum”** effect. What happens is that the most authentic way to make biryani is by mixing all the spices and sealing it for more than 5–6 hours on a slow fire, which renders its cooking it its own juices. Simply heaven!
